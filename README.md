Sudoku Solver - Internship Task 4

This project is a web-based Sudoku Solver built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It allows users to input a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle, solve it using a backtracking algorithm, and clear the board to try new puzzles.

Features

  Interactive 9x9 Sudoku grid.
  Input validation for numbers 1–9.
  Sudoku solving functionality using the backtracking algorithm.
  Clear button to reset the grid.
  Colorful and responsive user interface with external CSS.

Technologies Used

  HTML – For structuring the grid and layout.
  CSS – For styling and creating a colorful user-friendly interface.
  JavaScript – For implementing the Sudoku solving logic and handling user interactions.

How It Works

  The user enters a partially completed Sudoku puzzle into the grid.
  On clicking the "Solve" button, the script checks for validity and uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to find a solution.
  If a valid solution is found, the completed puzzle is displayed in the grid.
  The "Clear" button resets all the cells for a new puzzle.


Setup Instructions

  Clone the repository or download the source files.
  Open Task4.html in your preferred web browser.
  Enter the Sudoku puzzle values manually.
  Click "Solve" to get the solution or "Clear" to reset the board.

Learning Outcomes

  Learned to implement recursive algorithms in JavaScript.
  Gained experience in dynamic DOM manipulation.
  Practiced separating structure (HTML), design (CSS), and logic (JS).
  Developed an interactive tool simulating real-world problem solving.
